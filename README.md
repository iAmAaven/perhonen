# Perhonen
A passion project that I originally started for the Godot Wild Jam #72, with the theme "Light and Dark".
I decided to leave the game jam and start dedicating more time on this project. I believe the game has a beautiful story that has to be told.

# Current scope of the game
My plan is to finish and publish the game by the end of 2024. This deadline can (and probably will) be pushed further.
